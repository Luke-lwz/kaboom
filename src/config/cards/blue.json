Upon entering the opposing room, you must IMMEDIATELY grab any player of your choosing. Both you and that grabbed player return to the room from which you just left.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the chosen player is a character who is unaffected by powers (example: the Immunologist), Tentaclese's power has been wasted and you must IMMEDIATELY grab a different player.\r\n\r\nIf Tentaclese uses the TENTACLE power on a room's leader, the leader should immediately place the leader card on the ground. At this point, a new leader is nominated in the same method as the first round.\r\n\r\nYou may use the TENTACLE power during anytime EXCEPT FOR THE LAST ROUND. This can be done once per round.",
